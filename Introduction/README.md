<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Python</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language with a wide range of applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Python?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to learn and read</li>
        <li>Versatile - used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, etc.</li>
        <li>Large standard library</li>
        <li>Active community support</li>
        <li>Good career opportunities</li>
        <li>Interpreted language - code can be run immediately</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Installing Python:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python can be downloaded and installed from the official Python website (python.org). Choose the version that is appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running Python:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python code can be executed in two main ways: using the Python interactive shell and the Python console.</li>
  <li>The interactive shell allows you to type Python code directly and see the results immediately.</li>
  <li>The console is used to run Python scripts saved in files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using IDLE and IDE:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IDLE is an integrated development environment that comes bundled with Python. It provides a simple environment for writing and executing Python code.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can use more feature-rich IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Atom for a more advanced coding experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Third-Party Libraries:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries that extend its functionality.</li>
  <li>You can install these libraries using the package manager pip. For example, to install the pandas library, you would use the command 'pip install pandas'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working with Virtual Environments:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual environments are isolated environments for Python projects. They allow you to install dependencies specific to a project without affecting other projects.</li>
  <li>To create a virtual environment, you can use the 'venv' module (Python 3.3+) or the 'virtualenv' package. For example, to create a virtual environment named 'myenv', you would use the command 'python -m venv myenv'.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Tokens:</h2>
<p> A token is the smallest unit of a program that is meaningful to the compiler or interpreter. Tokens can be classified into several types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keywords</li>
  <li>Identifiers</li>
  <li>Literals</li>
  <li>Variable and constant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>
    Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names). These keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
</p>
<p>
    Here is the list of Python keywords:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>False</li>
    <li>class</li>
    <li>finally</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>return</li>
    <li>None</li>
    <li>continue</li>
    <li>for</li>
    <li>lambda</li>
    <li>try</li>
    <li>True</li>
    <li>def</li>
    <li>from</li>
    <li>nonlocal</li>
    <li>while</li>
    <li>and</li>
    <li>del</li>
    <li>global</li>
    <li>not</li>
    <li>with</li>
    <li>as</li>
    <li>elif</li>
    <li>if</li>
    <li>or</li>
    <li>yield</li>
    <li>assert</li>
    <li>else</li>
    <li>import</li>
    <li>pass</li>
    <li>break</li>
    <li>except</li>
    <li>in</li>
    <li>raise</li>
</ul>

<h3>identifiers:</h3>
<p>Identifiers are names given to entities in a program, such as variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. They are used to uniquely identify these entities within the program. In Python, identifiers must adhere to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores '_'.</li>
  <li>They must start with a letter or an underscore.</li>
  <li>They cannot start with a digit.</li>
  <li>They are case-sensitive ('myVar', 'MyVar', and 'myvar' are all different identifiers).</li>
  <li>They cannot be a keyword (reserved word) in Python (e.g., if, for, while, def, class, etc.).</li>
</ul>


<h3>literals:</h3>
<li>literals are data values that are written directly into the code, such as numbers, strings, or boolean values. They are called "literals" because they literally represent their value in the code.</li>

<h3>Variable  and constants:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Variable are identifiers used to represent memory location where data can be stored and manipulated. </li>
  <li>Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.</li>
</ul>
