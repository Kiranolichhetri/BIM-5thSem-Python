<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Python</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language with a wide range of applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Python?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to learn and read</li>
        <li>Versatile - used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, etc.</li>
        <li>Large standard library</li>
        <li>Active community support</li>
        <li>Good career opportunities</li>
        <li>Interpreted language - code can be run immediately</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Installing Python:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python can be downloaded and installed from the official Python website (python.org). Choose the version that is appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running Python:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python code can be executed in two main ways: using the Python interactive shell and the Python console.</li>
  <li>The interactive shell allows you to type Python code directly and see the results immediately.</li>
  <li>The console is used to run Python scripts saved in files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using IDLE and IDE:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IDLE is an integrated development environment that comes bundled with Python. It provides a simple environment for writing and executing Python code.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can use more feature-rich IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Atom for a more advanced coding experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Third-Party Libraries:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries that extend its functionality.</li>
  <li>You can install these libraries using the package manager pip. For example, to install the pandas library, you would use the command 'pip install pandas'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working with Virtual Environments:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual environments are isolated environments for Python projects. They allow you to install dependencies specific to a project without affecting other projects.</li>
  <li>To create a virtual environment, you can use the 'venv' module (Python 3.3+) or the 'virtualenv' package. For example, to create a virtual environment named 'myenv', you would use the command 'python -m venv myenv'.</li>
</ul>
